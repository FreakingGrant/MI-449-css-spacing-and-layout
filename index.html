        See, usually paragraph tags are block elements, meaning that every paragraph tag in the page gets stacked on top of each other. 
        They get their own lines. But what I did here is I wrapped them in a div tag, and then changed that div tag's display property
        to be inline-block. Now, this current paragraph won't be set on a new line, but rather right after the previous element,
        assuming that previous element is also displayed with an inline-block property.

        I actually made this sticker a couple months ago one day at work. My friend had sad "save the planet, kill yourself am I right?" at the beginning
        of last semester and I thought it was hilarious. So, I created a sticker for it, had some printed out, and now my stickers have been distributed.
